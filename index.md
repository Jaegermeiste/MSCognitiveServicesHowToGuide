## How-To Guide for using Microsoft Cognitive Services

Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services is a collection of APIs that, when combined, enable intelligent user interactions and insights into content.

To demonstrate Cognitive Services, this guide will walk through the creation of a Video Indexer API account.

### Video Indexer

Video Indexer combines several existing Cognitive Services tools to generate insights about the content of a video, including (but not limited to) facial recognition, speech-to-text transcripts, emotion analysis, and keyword recognition. In essence, it aggregates several existing Cognitive Services APIs such as the Face API, Speech-to-Text API, Speaker Recognition API, Text Analytics API, and the Bing Search API. It grew out of a former Microsoft research project called Video Breakdown and was recently soft launched at NAB Las Vegas and formally launched at [Build 2017](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bluesky/2017/05/11/build-2017-cognitive-services-update-en/).

In the time taken to develop this How-To Guide, the official documentation has improved significantly and several bugs have been ironed out in the API itself (originally, all video uploads failed unceremoniously). Some basic documentation is still missing - for example, supported video types are undocumented. MP4 videos work, so we will use those for this guide.
