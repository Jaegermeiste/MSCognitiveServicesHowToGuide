## Examining Uploaded Files

If you return to [https://www.videoindexer.ai/](https://www.videoindexer.ai/), which is the first account created at the beggining of this How-To Guide, you can see an overview of all videos currently uploaded to your account.

Playing any of the videos uploaded results in a window where both the Player and Insights widgets are present; and they are linked as were the widgets we scripted previously. Clicking on an Insight jumps the Player to the appropriate time, and vice versa.

With this, we have covered all significant aspects of the Azure Cognitive Services Video Indexer API. Other API calls are available, and the API is expanding rapidly - methods implementing search, file deletion, and reindexing (added by Microsoft on 5/28/2017!) and more can be read about these at [Video Indexer API](https://videobreakdown.portal.azure-api.net/docs/services/582074fb0dc56116504aed75/operations/592ac3d50dc56105b44f0608).
